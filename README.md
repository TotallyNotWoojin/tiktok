This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To start the development server, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can begin editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you make changes.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family from Vercel.
